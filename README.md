# Mytra-Clone
Myntra Clone Project
This project is a fully responsive clone of the Myntra website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project was to replicate the design and functionality of a modern e-commerce platform, giving me hands-on experience in front-end development. Through this process, I learned how to structure web pages effectively using HTML, style them creatively with CSS, and add interactivity using JavaScript.

Working on this project not only strengthened my understanding of these technologies but also allowed me to explore new concepts like responsive design, layout techniques, and user-friendly interfaces. As part of my coding journey, I am constantly challenging myself by building projects like this to enhance my skills and stay updated with best practices in web development. This project is a step forward in my commitment to learning and growing as a web developer.
